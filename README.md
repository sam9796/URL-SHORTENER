# URL SHORTENER

It's a nodejs application whose frontend is built using react and in this project one can paste long urls and they will get a short url which they can paste in their browser to get the same website whose url was entered to shorten

It's frontend is running using react production build so whenever you are inside the folder urlSHortener just use the command 'npm install' to install all the backend dependencies and for database I have used my own mongodb atlas account and after all the dependencies are installed run the command 'nodemon server.js' to launch the application and later you can navigate to your browser and enter 'localhost:8081' to see the application and please only visit port 8081 after you see 'MongoDB Conneected' and 'Server started on port 8081' in the backend console

First of all the server.js file consist of the backend of application you will see 5 APIs in there including one that is used to render the build of react and there is db.js file in config which is used to connect to my mongodb atlas account and there is URL.js in models which is the schema that is used to store data which has clicks, shortID, longURL, Note. Frontend which is inside client directory we have 3 files inside src/components, one is Spinner.js which  I have used at only one place in app.js so when you have entered a url to shorten then a useState constant loading is set to true and on screen you will see spinner else you will see url list and then there is InputURL.js where you will have the UI for entering your url and note and when you will enter those and click on generate the API is called in App.js to shorten the url and display it on the screen and last file is urlList.js which contains UI for search utility and all the data stored in backend is rendered in urlList.js so urlList.js is rendered according to 2 useState constants 'search' and 'result' as you will see in useEffect so whenever there is text in search input you will get the result related to that word typed in search input and else you will get all the database data so two APIs used here aree '/api/search' used to get data according to what is typed in search box and '/api/getAllUrls' which is used to get all the data in database and also I have used materialize-css which is like bootstrap but I have not used it much.

While working on the project I read the article 'https://blog.logrocket.com/how-build-url-shortener-node-js/' for knowing what's a url-shortener and how it works and also they have used nanoid and I have used shortid to generate some random strings for the long urls. I have learned about url-shortener for the first time and its backend working so this was a whole new concept for me.
